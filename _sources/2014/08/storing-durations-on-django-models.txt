Storing durations on Django models
##################################

I just released a package on PyPI:
`thecut-durationfield <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thecut-durationfield>`__
is a Django app that provides model and form fields for working with
durations. The durations are stored as `ISO
8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`__ compatible strings, and
the model field returns
`dateutil.relativedelta <http://labix.org/python-dateutil#head-ba5ffd4df8111d1b83fc194b97ebecf837add454>`__
objects.

I've been using it for things like subscription models, where I want to
figure out when a customer needs to be charged.

The code is up on
`github <https://github.com/thecut/thecut-durationfield>`__, so take a
look and if you have any problems, get in touch.
