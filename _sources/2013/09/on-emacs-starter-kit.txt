On emacs-starter-kit
####################

I've been using Emacs exclusively for something like five years now, but
I still feel like a newbie a lot of the time. Emacs is a big, complex
beast. I have a relatively small set of techniques that I rely on for
moving around and editing text, and there aren't a lot of major modes
that I use, outside of the built in python mode.

One of the things that I've been using for a long time is the excellent
`emacs-starter-kit <https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit>`__.
Without this package, I probably would not have stuck with Emacs for
very long. So I'm very grateful to
`technomancy <http://technomancy.us/>`__ for creating it.

However, in an effort to get better at Emacs, I've decided to move to
using my own custom configuration. This is largely so that I can be more
aware of which modes I'm using and hence get better at using them. I
feel like I'm missing out on a lot of functionality because I'm not
really aware of what's available.

I'm also hoping that it will help me pick up elisp, so I can write some
custom modes for myself. I've been interested in picking up a lisp for a
while, but there are a lot of options and no particular reason for me to
pick one over another. But if I pick up elsip, then I'll be more
comfortable extending Emacs, and it should make picking up other lisps
in the future easier.

I'd still strongly recommend using
`emacs-starter-kit <https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit>`__
if you're new to Emacs, it's fantastic for getting a feel for how
powerful the editor can be. It's ironic that the point in your Emacs
career when you are the least capable of producing a complex and
opinionated configuration is the same point at which you would most
benefit from one.
`emacs-starter-kit <https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit>`__
is a great solution to that dilemna.
