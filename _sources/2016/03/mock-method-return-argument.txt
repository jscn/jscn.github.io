How to mock a method so it returns the argument you pass it
###########################################################

While I was refactoring and adding tests for a pretty hairy method, I found
that I wanted to mock out some methods on the object so that they just returned
whatever value was passed into them. It turns out that's pretty easy to do,
although it took me a little while to figure it out. To save you (and future
me) the time, here's how.

Given an instance `request` with a method `complex_method` which takes a single
argument, replace `complex_method` with a mock which returns the argument
unchanged:

.. code-block:: python

    from mock import Mock
    request.complex_method = Mock(side_effect=lambda arg: arg)

Subsequent calls to `complex_method` will return unchanged whatever you pass
it:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> request.complex_method(True)
    True
    >>> request.complex_method(False)
    False
    >>> request.complex_method('amazing!')
    'amazing!'
