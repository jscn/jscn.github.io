Io Day One Self-Study
#####################

Long day today, so I just did the Day 1 Self-Study section. It looks
like `the official mailing list
<http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/iolanguage/>`__ is livelier than

and `StackOverflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/iolanguage>`__.

``0`` and ``""`` evaluate to true, ``nil`` evaluates to false.

``=`` assigns to a slot or raises an error of none exists ``:=`` assigns

to say about Io, and even used it to write a little web framework
called `yown <https://github.com/whymirror/yown>`__. Now you know.
