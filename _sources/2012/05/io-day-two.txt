Io Day Two
##########

So in Day 2, we start by looking at the other language feature we need
in order to really do anything: flow control. That's all fairly straight
forward. You've got your *while*, your *for* and your
*if...then...else*.

The third section, *Reflection*, is also fairly straightforward. An
object can look at it's own slots, and the slots of it's ancestors.

I don't want to say the middle section, *Messages*, was confusing,
because it was more like *totally opaque*. It's not so much hard to
understand as *I just don't get what the big deal is.* Which leads me to
suspect that I've missed the point. I expect I won't really understand
it until I get through doing the self study exercises. But that will
have to wait until tomorrow.

The one other thing I learned today, is that an hour is not really long
enough to make much progress. At this rate, it's going to take at least
a couple days to make it out the other side of Day 2, and I expect Day 3
will take even longer. So this might not be so much *Seven Languages in
Seven Weeks* as *Seven Languages in Several Months*.
