TIL: DEBUG=True will eat all your memory
########################################

So, there I was synchronising several thousand database records with a
3rd party server. Off I go to `take care of some serious business while
I wait <http://xkcd.com/303/>`__ for the sync to complete. But when I
return instead of seeing a nicely up-to-date database, my machine is
thrashing so hard it's almost completely unresponsive. Turns out Python
is eating up 80% of the memory.

So I pile into optimising the code that does the syncing. No luck there.
(I mean, the code's better but Python still eats all the memory.) So I
figure I better take a look at exactly what's taking up all that space.
While looking for some memory profiling tools, I come across this post
on `debugging memory leaks in
Django. <http://www.toofishes.net/blog/using-guppy-debug-django-memory-leaks/>`__

Note especially point #3:

    Remember that if you have DEBUG = True, you will see an
    ever-increasing heap because of the queries being cached on the
    connection object.

Oh. I see. Yep, that fixes it. Python now consumes a mere 0.8% or the
system memory, and all is well.
