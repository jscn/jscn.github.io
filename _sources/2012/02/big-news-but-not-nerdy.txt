Big news. But not nerdy.
########################

It's been quiet here lately. That's because I've been very busy. With
what, you ask? Is dealing with incessant earthquakes not enough? No?
Well, I've also been busy with moving from my hometown of Christchurch,
New Zealand to Perth, Australia. I quit my job at the end of January and
arrived in Perth on the 15th. I've wanted to leave Christchurch for a
while, and the earthquakes provided an impetus to actually do something
about it.

For the last few years, I've been focused on finding problems with
software systems. I spent 40 hours a week looking at things other people
had created and finding fault with their work. I was good at it. I found
a lot of bugs. But it's easy to find fault. I mean, it can be difficult
to find a particular fault. But it's easy to fall into a frame of mind
where *all you do* is find problems with other people's work. There's
very little risk in that. But it's also unsatisfying after while.

So, I've been trying to transition into getting paid for creating
stuff, instead. It's been a bumpy ride so far. I started freelancing for
some\ `great guys <http://sons.co.nz/>`__ who were (and still are)
creating some `awesome
work <http://bestawards.co.nz/studio/sons-and-co/>`__. But just as I was
starting to find my stride, my city `fell
down <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake>`__
around me. Christchurch's infrastructure was crushed, the business
district was destroyed and my burgeoning freelance programming business
dried up.

When the ground shifts and things become unstable, you go back to what
you know. So I returned to an old employer and started finding bugs
again. After a few months I switched roles and started fixing the bugs.
But once you've had the pleasure of creating whole new projects, it's
difficult to go back. So now, I'm focusing on learning and creating new
stuff. I'm going to be writing more code, contributing to open source
and generally spending my time building things. Of course, I also need
to get paid, so if you're in Perth and you're looking for a keen
contributor, give me a `shout <mailto:josh.crompton@gmail.com>`__.
