Seven Languages in Seven Weeks
##############################

So today I'm starting a chain. Everyday I'm going to spend at least one
pomomdoro working through `Seven Languages in Seven
Days <http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks>`__,
a book from Pragmatic Programmers. Everyday I'll publish a post about
what I did and what I learned. I've worked through the Ruby chapter
before, and recently ran through the `Ruby
Koans <http://www.rubykoans.com/>`__, too, so I'm going to skip that
chapter and dive straight into Io. The author says he felt he understood
Javascript better after spending some time with Io, and I'm hoping the
same will be true for me.
