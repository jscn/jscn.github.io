How to use sessions in Django unit tests
########################################

If you've tried using sessions with the Django test client as the
`official documentation
describes <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/#django.test.client.Client.session>`__,
you'll have noticed that **it doesn't work.**

There are a couple bugs in the Django ticket system around this, the
main one being https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10899, but there's
been no movement on it for 8 months. However, that ticket has the code
you need to get your sessions working.

So if you want to use sessions in your tests (e.g., to test whether a
view is adding the right stuff to the session), add the following to the
setUp() method of your test case:

.. code-block:: python

    def setUp(self):
        from django.conf import settings
	engine = import_module(settings.SESSION_ENGINE)
	store = engine.SessionStore()
	store.save()  # we need to make load() work, or the cookie is worthless
	self.client.cookies[settings.SESSION_COOKIE_NAME] = store.session_key

Now when you access ``self.client.session`` in your tests, it'll
actually remember any changes made to it during the course of the test.
