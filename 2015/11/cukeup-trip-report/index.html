<h1>CukeUp! AU 2015 Highlights<a class="headerlink" href="#cukeup-au-2015-highlights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Recently I was lucky enough to attend <a class="reference external" href="https://cucumber.io/events/cukeup-australia-2015">CukeUp!</a> in Sydney. It&#8217;s the first time that the conference has been run in Australia, and I hope it&#8217;s not the last. I really liked the format, with morning and afternoon talks bookending workshops which ran before and after lunch. Technical conferences can sometimes become a strange kind of spectator sport. The workshops really helped me get out of that mode and get engaged.</p>
<p>The crowd was really friendly and diverse, with people from all kinds of backgrounds and disciplines. I think developers may have actually been in the minority, with a lot of testers and BAs in attendance. The speakers were friendly and approachable, and I had some great conversations. Below are some of the talks and workshops that were highlights for me.</p>
<div class="section" id="twelve-bdd-anti-patterns">
<h2>Twelve BDD Anti-Patterns<a class="headerlink" href="#twelve-bdd-anti-patterns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/wakaleo">John Smart&#8217;s</a> talk, <em>Twelve BDD Anti-Patterns: Stories from the Trenches about how NOT to do Behaviour Driven Development</em>, was probably the most technical of the conference. Which is saying something, because I don&#8217;t remember seeing a single line of code. In fact, most of the anti-patterns John described come down to focusing on the technical tooling instead of collaboration. It turned out this would be a recurring theme of the conference, which I didn&#8217;t expect but was surprisingly refreshing!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-mapping">
<h2>Example Mapping<a class="headerlink" href="#example-mapping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mattwynne">Matt Wynne</a> ran a great workshop on <em>Example Mapping</em>, which he describes as &#8220;a simple, practical technique that you can use to break down any user story&#8221;. I&#8217;ve already started trying these sessions at the dayjob, so this was probably the most actionable workshop of the conference for me.</p>
<p>I did notice that it was quite hard for the group to maintain focus on the story in hand. A lot of tangents came up, and we drifted off topic and had some difficulty coming up with really good outputs. This has also been the case when I tried the technique at work, so I&#8217;m left wondering how to prepare <em>before</em> the session to prevent that. I&#8217;d love to see a set of entry criteria for running one of these sessions.</p>

<h2>Be the Collaboration Hero Your Agile Team Needs You to Be<a class="headerlink" href="#be-the-collaboration-hero-your-agile-team-needs-you-to-be" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This workshop, run by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PrettyAgile">Em Campbell-Pretty</a>, was <em>really</em> good. The workshop was itself an example of the techniques taught in the workshop, so we got to see Em modelling the behaviours first-hand. Because it went so smoothly, it was also a demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach&#8211;clever!</p>
<p>There were a few questions about how to effectively collaborate with remote teams. One thing Em suggested that stood out to me was to ensure that everyone, even the co-located team, dial in using the same conferencing software. This puts everyone on the same footing, dealing with the same communication problems, rather than privileging the co-located folks.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-next">
<h2>What next?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-next" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If CuekUp! runs again next year, especially if it runs in Melbourne (hint, hint), it&#8217;ll be at the top of my conference list. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to bring some co-workers with me. In the meantime, I have plenty of ideas to try out (and books to read).</p>
