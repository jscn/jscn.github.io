<h2>Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>by Sandi Metz</em></p>
<p>This book was the best thing I read about software development all year. I had avoided reading it for a while because I&#8217;m not fond of Ruby, but decided to make a go of it after hearing Sandi speak on a <a class="reference external" href="http://giantrobots.fm/51">couple</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://rubyrogues.com/087-rr-book-clubpractical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-with-sandi-metz/">podcasts</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M">conference talks</a> she gave on the same topic. This book has made me much more conscious of the design decisions I make in my code, and how to write unit tests that are a help, not a hindrance. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how things evolve as I try to apply the techniques in production code.</p>
<p>With clear examples and explanations, Sandi covers how to design unit tests to make code easy to change; composition versus inheritance; designing good APIs for your objects; how to avoid writing big, hard to change classes by writing lots of small, easy to change classes; and more, all while weaving in all the SOLID principles using concrete examples. This book has excellent content and delivery; in my mind it&#8217;s a model example for how to write a technical book that is engaging and useful.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working with an object oriented language such as Python, Ruby or JavaScript, I highly recommend you read this book as soon as possible. Don&#8217;t let the &#8220;in Ruby&#8221; part of the title scare you away, the content is relevant to any OO language.</p>

<h2>Backbone.js Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#backbone-js-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>by Ryan Roemer</em></p>
<p>I read this book mid-way through the year. I was starting to do more JavaScript development at my dayjob, and had made the decision to go with backbone.js as a way to bring more structure to what I was doing. I did not relish the thought of wading through the quagmire that is the JavaScript eco-system, trying to work out what the best combination of tools would be to allow me to test my JavaScript code. This book was an excellent, no-nonsense guide that allowed me to hit the ground running and be effective quickly, without wasting time on decisions which I would probably later regret.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is extraneous; you are given a list of tools to use and shown how to use them to test your code. If you&#8217;re starting to do more front end development and want to be effective quickly, pick up this book and get started.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-books">
<h2>Other books<a class="headerlink" href="#other-books" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I also started several technical books but didn&#8217;t finish them.</p>
<div class="section" id="building-backbone-plugins">
<h3>Building Backbone Plugins<a class="headerlink" href="#building-backbone-plugins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>by Derick Bailey and Jerome Gravel-Niquet</em></p>
<p>Derick Bailey wrote the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Marrionette.js</span></code> framework, which sits on top of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">backbone.js</span></code>, taking care of some of the boilerplate code that you often need when working directly with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">backbone.js</span></code>. I may yet finish this book before the end of the year, which is a pretty good sign considering I&#8217;m meant to be on vacation. The book takes you through examples of extracting code from applications written with backbone.js into plugins. It basically exposes the author&#8217;s thinking as he wrote <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Marrionette.js</span></code>. Tentatively recommended, as I haven&#8217;t finished reading it yet.</p>

<h3>Understanding Computation<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-computation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>by Tom Stuart</em></p>
<p>I dropped this book because I was reading a lot of stuff related to my dayjob, and I didn&#8217;t have the time or mental bandwidth to follow all the threads simultaneously. I plan to complete this one in 2015. Again, it&#8217;s a book written in Ruby, but I was working on the exercises using Python. This actually helped me understand the content better. The translation from Ruby to Python meant I wasn&#8217;t so fixated on the implementation, and I learned some things about Python, too. Great book so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="professional-javascript-for-web-developers">
<h3>Professional JavaScript for Web Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#professional-javascript-for-web-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>by Nicholas C. Zakas</em></p>
<p>This was the first book I was to read in my plan for actually learning JavaScript properly. Again, I put it down to focus on things more immediately relevant for work and haven&#8217;t picked it up again. It&#8217;s pretty dry and pretty long, but also pretty complete, so I plan on finishing it next year.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mastering-object-oriented-python">
<h3>Mastering Object Oriented Python<a class="headerlink" href="#mastering-object-oriented-python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>by Steven F. Lott</em></p>
<p>Another long, dry but complete book. This was recommended as a good way to level up my Python skills. I put it down after reading the first couple of chapters because I was already familiar with the material. However, I think it&#8217;s worth giving it another more serious shot. It looks like later chapters deal with some more obscure material.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="addendum">
<h3>Addendum<a class="headerlink" href="#addendum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I am very surprised to find I have only finished two programming books this year (out of a total of thirty-something books). I feel like I&#8217;ve done so much technical reading this year. I think the fact is that I just read a lot of blog posts and news. Also, I started several technical books and never finished them. I think there are two reasons for this: either I dropped a book for something more directly related to my dayjob, or the barrier to reading and taking notes was just too high. Turns out, I really don&#8217;t like reading technical books in a digital format. I want to highlight, make notes in the margin and engage with the material. I need a physical book to do that. Next year I&#8217;ll try to buy more physical copies of technical books in the hope that I get through more of them.</p>
